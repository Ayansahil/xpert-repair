          Common RO Purifier Problems We Solve
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-[#939393] mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          From slow water flow to unusual taste, our technicians can diagnose
          and resolve any issue with your RO system.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-[#939393] mb-6 space-y-4">
          <li className="text-[#747474]">
            <strong>Water Leakage:</strong> Constant dripping from the faucet or
            cracks in the filter housing can waste water and damage your
            kitchen. We find and fix the source.
          </li>
          <li className="text-[#747474]">
            <strong>No Water or Slow Flow:</strong> Low water pressure or
            clogged filters can stop water flow. We diagnose if it&apos;s a
            filter issue or a problem with the water supply.
          </li>
          <li className="text-[#747474]">
            <strong>Bad Taste or Odor:</strong> If your water tastes or smells
            strange, it&apos;s a clear sign your filters or RO membrane are
            exhausted and need immediate replacement.
          </li>
          <li className="text-[#747474]">
            <strong>Continuous Drainage:</strong> When the system constantly
            sends water to the drain, it could be a faulty automatic shut-off
            valve, leading to high water bills.
          </li>
          <li className="text-[#747474]">
            <strong>Motor Not Working:</strong> The RO booster pump is essential
            for purification. If it&apos;s not starting, we can repair or
            replace it to get your system running again.
          </li>
